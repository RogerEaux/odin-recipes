A website for displaying various recipes

This project is about a website that shows different recipes in its home page than you can then click on to get a more detailed description. With this project, I will demonstrate my ability to create web pages using html by displaying text and correctly identifying the importance it should have, linking the home page with the different recipe pages and including images in them.
